//! MP-SPDZ as a library.
//!
//! The measurements this replaces were taken by launching a party binary and
//! matching regular expressions against what it printed. That works until the
//! wording changes, and it cannot see anything the binary does not choose to
//! print. The engine already keeps every round and every byte in a structure;
//! this reads that structure.
//!
//! What is deliberately not attempted: reimplementing the protocol. The
//! malicious-security machinery --- the MACs, the sacrificing, the verification
//! --- is what makes the overhead figure mean anything, and a reimplementation
//! would replace a number about a mature engine with a number about this crate.
//! The engine stays; only the way its results are read changes.
//!
//! The crate builds without MP-SPDZ present, in which case [`available`] is
//! false and [`run`] returns [`Error::EngineAbsent`]. Most machines do not have
//! a checkout, and a workspace that will not compile without one is worse than
//! one that says so.
