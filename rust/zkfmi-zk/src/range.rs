//! Range proofs, delegated to the audited `bulletproofs` crate.
//!
//! This replaces a bit-decomposition proof built from our own bit proofs. The
//! swap is worth stating precisely: proving is about the same speed, but
//! verification is a single multiscalar multiplication instead of one sigma
//! check per bit, and the proof is logarithmic instead of linear. Aggregation
//! then makes a settlement's several ranges share one proof.
//!
//! One constraint comes with it: bit widths must be powers of two. A rail tuned
//! to 24 or 40 bits has to round up to 32 or 64, which changes how the
//! split-rail sizing plays out.
