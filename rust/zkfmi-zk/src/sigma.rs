//! The sigma protocols this system needs, none of which an audited crate

//! The crates that do exist for this — `sigma-proofs`, `sigma-protocols`,

//! not make pay: a point addition there costs a quarter of a scalar
//! multiplication because of the call overhead, against 1/256 here, so batching
