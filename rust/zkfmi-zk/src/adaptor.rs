//! Adaptor signatures: a signature that is finished by a secret, and finishing
//! it hands that secret back.
//!
//! This exists for payment versus payment across two ledgers that share no
//! state. Fair exchange between two parties with no third party is impossible
//! in general, so something has to leak from one side to the other; the only
//! question is what, and to whom. A hash lock leaks a preimage that appears in
//! the clear on both ledgers, which links the two legs for anyone who reads
//! both --- and linking the legs is exactly what the rest of this system spends
//! its cost preventing.
//!
//! An adaptor signature leaks a scalar instead, and only to the party who holds
//! the pre-signature. What lands on either ledger is an ordinary Schnorr
//! signature. A third party reading both ledgers sees two unrelated signatures:
//! there is no shared value to match on, because the nonce points differ by `Y`
//! and `Y` never appears.
//!
//! The construction is the standard one. For a key `X = g^x`, an adaptor point
//! `Y = g^y` and a message `m`:
//!
//! ```text
//! pre-sign   R = g^r,  c = H(R + Y, X, m),  s' = r + c x     -> (R, s')
//! verify     g^{s'} == R + c X
//! adapt      s = s' + y                                      -> (R + Y, s)
//! extract    y = s - s'
//! ```
//!
//! The adapted pair is an ordinary Schnorr signature under nonce point `R + Y`,
//! so a ledger that already verifies Schnorr needs no new code to accept it ---
//! which is the property that makes this usable across a ledger that knows
//! nothing about the swap.
//!
//! What this does *not* do is make the exchange safe on its own. Whoever holds
//! `y` acts first and always has the option not to act, so the party who moves
//! second needs a deadline behind it. That belongs to the protocol, not here;
//! see `defmi`'s `pvp`.
