//! Why `n_slots` has to be at least the number of makers.
//!
//! The key a maker is ranked by is `(gated + 2*sentinel) * n_slots + index`, and
//! the verifier rebuilds it in the exponent from the maker's own gated
//! commitment and its own index. That is a bijection on `(cost, index)` only
//! while `index < n_slots`. Past that it wraps, and two different makers at two
//! different costs produce the *same* key commitment --- so a proof that the
//! opened key is the minimum no longer says which maker it belongs to.
//!
//! produced `artifacts/threshold_assembly.json` ran sixteen makers into eight
//! slots. The paper cites a number from that row. `QuoteCircuit::prove` now
//! refuses the configuration; this is the arithmetic that says why.
