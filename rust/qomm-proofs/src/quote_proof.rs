//! Publicly verifiable proof that the opened quote is the correct one.
//!
//! Receipts bind a node to a result; they do not show the result is right. This
//! closes that gap for the quote circuit, without a general-purpose SNARK and
//! without a trusted setup, by proving the statement the circuit computes:
//!
//! > for each maker `i`, `key_i` is the committed policy applied to the
//! > committed request, and the opened winner is the smallest of those keys.
//!
//! Every step is a sigma protocol over Pedersen commitments, which matters
//! twice. Sigma responses are affine in the witness, so a quorum of computing
//! nodes can assemble the proof from shares without any of them holding it. And
//! the result is checked by an ordinary verifier with no setup.
//!
//! Per maker:
//!
//! ```text
//! depth_i = slope_i * qty              product proof
//! skew_i  = invcoef_i * inv_i          product proof
//! ask_i   = ask_level_i + depth_i + skew_i                linear, free
//! bid_i   = ask_level_i - spread_i - depth_i + skew_i     linear, free
//! fits_i  = maxqty_i - qty >= 0        range proof
//! fresh_i = expiry_i - now  >= 0       range proof
//! ok_i    is a bit, and gates the cost bit + product proofs
//! key_i   = cost_i * M + i             linear, free
//! ```
//!
//! and over the whole set: the winner's commitment opens to the revealed value,
//! and `key_i - v >= 0` for every `i`. Minimality plus membership is exactly
//! "v is the minimum", so an incorrect winner cannot be proved.
//!
//! decompositions at an arbitrary width; here they are Bulletproofs, which take
//! powers of two, so a declared width rounds up. Each maker's two eligibility
//! ranges share one aggregated proof, and so do the minimality ranges, which is
//! why the proof does not grow linearly the way the original did.
