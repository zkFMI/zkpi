//! Zero-knowledge audit of a maker's *state update*, not only its policy.
//!
//! `policy_audit` shows the pricing rule is well formed. That covers the rule
//! and says nothing about what happens after a fill, which in a stateful
//! protocol is the larger half: a maker with an impeccable rule can still carry
//! a book that never moved when it should have, or that quietly grew past the
//! size it promised to stop at.
//!
//! Three things are proved per fill, without opening anything.
//!
//! - *arithmetic* — the new inventory is the old one less what was filled, as a
//!   linear relation over three commitments
//! - *containment* — the new inventory lies inside a limit that is itself
//!   committed, so the venue learns the promise was kept without learning
//!   either the promise or the position
//! - *continuity* — each step names the state it followed, so replaying an old
//!   state or running two books in parallel breaks the chain
//!
//! Containment needs a committed bound rather than a public one. A public band
//! would have to be wide enough for the largest maker on the venue, which makes
//! it vacuous for everyone else; a private limit holds a maker to the promise it
//! actually made. The bound is committed once and every later step proves
//! against that same commitment, so tightening it after a breach is not
//! available either.
