//! zkPI: a payment instruction that can be verified without being read.
//!
//! The point of the construction is that a settlement venue runs exactly two
//! operations --- verify the instruction, and check the nullifier has not been
//! seen --- and neither depends on how the price was reached. That makes it
//! pluggable: a venue with its own matching engine can accept instructions from
//! this issuer, or from any issuer speaking the same interface, without
//! adopting the rest of the design.
//!
//! The quorum signature is FROST rather than the threshold sigma protocol the
//! audit behind it; there was no reason to keep a hand-rolled one.
