//! One way of reporting a repeated measurement, shared by every benchmark.
//!
//! A bare median says what one number came out and nothing about whether it
//! means anything. Two runs of the same benchmark on one machine have disagreed
//! by half again here, and a reader --- including a later version of us --- cannot
//! tell that from a single figure. So every timing carries how many samples it
//! is made of and how far they spread.
//!
//! Both a mean and a median are kept, deliberately. Timings are right-skewed:
//! one scheduling hiccup pulls the mean and leaves the median alone, so the
//! median is what to compare and the mean is what the standard deviation belongs
//! to. When the two disagree by much, that is itself the finding.
//!
//! Deterministic quantities do not go through this. A proof's byte length and a
//! compiled round count are the same on every run, and dressing them with a
//! standard deviation of zero would claim a measurement nobody made. [`Exact`]
//! marks those so the two kinds cannot be confused downstream.
