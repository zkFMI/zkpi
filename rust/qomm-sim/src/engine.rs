//! One simulation arm = (request protocol) x (disclosure mechanism).
//!
//! The protocol decides *who observes a request*; the disclosure mechanism
//! decides *what the public learns afterwards*. Both vary independently, which
//! is what lets the study attribute an effect to one or the other.
//!
//! What a maker or an outside observer sees at request time:
//!
//! ```text
//! plain_rfq  asset, size, direction, wallet, time   (every queried maker)
//! plain_rfm  asset, size, wallet, time              (direction withheld)
//! plain_rfs  asset, wallet, request window          (size withheld)
//! qomm_*     nothing --- the request never reaches a maker
//! ```
//!
//! A settled trade is visible in every arm. The arms therefore differ in what
//! they reveal about requests that did *not* execute, and about direction before
//! execution --- which is exactly what the detection metric scores.
