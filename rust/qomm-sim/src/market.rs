//! Reference market, order flow and maker behaviour.
//!
//! The pricing rule here is the same function the MPC circuit evaluates,
//!
//! ```text
//! ask_i = mid_i + half_i + slope_i * x + invcoef_i * inv_i
//! bid_i = mid_i - half_i - slope_i * x + invcoef_i * inv_i
//! ```
//!
//! so a simulation result and a circuit result can be checked against each
//! other. All quantities are integers: prices in ticks, sizes in lots.
//!
//! Every draw goes through [`crate::deterministic_random`], whose stream is
//! fixed by checked vectors. Published runs therefore use the same market,
//! rather than merely another market with the same distribution.
